# Compilation of Best Peruvian Restaurants in Miami

Hey CodePath team, this is my first website created using React.
There's many Peruvian restaurants out there and it's hard to know where to start.
Me and some Peruvian friends compiled a list of the best places to start with.
Hope you enjoy it!

Specs:
- Created RestaurantCard React component that includes the restaurant name, a rating, and a button that takes you to yelp or google review link for more info.
- Made a Table under App.jsx where I imported the RestaurantCard component to be used per restaurant added.
- Added an image separately under each td.
- Imported images and saved all under one folder
